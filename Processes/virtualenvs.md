# Pipenv & Virtual Environments

The following steps come from [The Hitchhiker's Guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

Assume all instructions are for python 3.x version.

## [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

1. Ensure python is installed by running this at command prompt or Anaconda:  `python --version`

2. Ensure pip is available: `pip --version`

3. Install dependency manager for your projects:  `pip install --user pipenv`

4. When ready to install packages for your project:
   - Change into your project directory:  `cd DIRECTORY`
   - Run: `pipenv install MODULENAME` (where MODULENAME is something like **requests**)

   This installs the library & creates a Pipfile (used to track dependencies in case you need to reinstall them).

5. When looking to run your script: `pipenv run python FILENAME.py`

   Using `pipenv run` ensures your installed packages are available to your script.

## virtualenv

More on this was covered in [Virtual Environments](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/updates/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md).

Basically **virtualenv** is a tool to create isolated Python environments. It creates a folder that has all the necessary executables to use the packages your project would need.

It can also be used standalone - _in place of Pipenv_!

1. Install via pip: `pip install virtualenv`

2. Test your installation:`virtualenv --version`

3. Change into the directory of your project: `cd DIRECTORY`

4. Create a virtual environment:  `virtualenv ENVNAME`

   If you omit the name of the environment, this will **not** create a folder for all the executable files & copy of your pip library. It will just put them in the current folder.

   **NOTE:** conventional name is to use venv as it is readily available in ignore files.

For fancier commands, check out the [original MD file](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/updates/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md).

5. Activate your virtual environment
   - Linux: `source VENVNAME/bin/activate`
   - PC:  `\venv\Scripts\activate`

  The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt to let you know that itâ€™s active. From now on, any package that you install using pip will be placed in the venv folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

6. Install packages as normal

7. When you have your packages, it is best practice to "freeze" the current state of environment packages to a file: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

   You can see the list by running: `pip list`

   You are able to install the requirements later by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

8. Be sure to add your venv to the gitignore list.

9. When done with venv: `deactivate`

10. To delete you just need to delete the folder of the venv: `rm -rf NAME`
