# Explanation Of Docs

Since we're in the [cheatsheets](../) portion of [my GitHub](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart), I decided to create a section for documentation templates.

The more I learn on my journey as a computer scientist / data scientist, the more I find it beneficial to simply just have an empty template for my different projects & documentation.

Why reinvent the wheel, right?

# Table Of Contents

1. [CRISP-DM](CRISP-DM):  "Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining"

According to [the IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_overview.htm), this "is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts" - and quite frankly? It makes the organizer in me VERY happy!

<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_overview.htm"><img align="middle" src="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/images/crisp_process.gif"></img></a>

As a **methodolody** it includes:
- descriptions of the typical phases of a project
- tasks involved with each phase
- an explanation of the relationships between tasks

As a **process model**:
- provides an overview of the data mining life cycle

By following this process, you are able to create a data mining model that fits your particulat needs.

I have taken what I have learned & crafted my own blank template inside of this section. Including but not limited to:
- [folder structure](CRISP-DM/README.MD) for future code projects
- [fluid documentation](CRISP-DM/docs)
