# Data Mining Goals

Produce time-series models that can be used for the following purposes:

- Long Term Forecasts
    - establish baseline or expected initial data
    - assist with future planning
    - provide valuable insights into current process
    - provide valuable insights into future process
- Short Term Forecasts
    - TBD

## Hypothesis

TBD

## Subsets

TBD

# Data Mining Success Criteria

This will outline:
- model performance
- model explainability
- scalability

The time-series models will implement a classification problem:
    TBD

A high quality model will:
- TBD

## Different Forecast Period Metrics

While overall metrics are useful, additional metrics for different forecast periods may also be useful.
- TBD

The idea is that TBD.

## Capturing Data For Validation, Maintenance & Champion-Challenger

The solution should capture enough data to:
- recreate how it arrived at its predictions over time
- compare to predictions of alternate methods
- chart performance of models over time for quality, maintenance, and business value validation purposes
