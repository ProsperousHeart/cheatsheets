# cheatsheets
This repo will be all of the cheatsheets I would like to create for myself to be used with referral

At some point this page will look like [this](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/XlsxWriter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) but for now, what's on this page will suffice. ^_^

# Why Did I Create This?

Honestly? Mostly for me. :)

But I also own a business where I provide coaching within my scope of programming. What better way to provide value to my students than with freebies like cheatsheets? Cause seriously ... who doesn't just LOVE a good cheat sheet?
