# What Is A Jupyter Notebook?

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include (but are not limited to):
- testing
- data cleaning and transformation
- numerical simulation
- statistical modeling
- data visualization
- machine learning
... and much more.

It even works with over 40 different programming languages!

# How Do I [Install It](https://jupyter.org/install.html) On My System?

You can run one of the following from your terminal (depending on your python version):
- `pip3 install jupyter`
- `pip install jupyter`

If you prefer to use [Anaconda](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/Anaconda.md) this is best for beginners. Especially since it already has Jupyter AND python installed!
